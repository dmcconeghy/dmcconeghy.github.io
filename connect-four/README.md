My version of Connect Four was coded for unit 11 of Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track. 
It features a turn indicator on mouseover, a falling CSS animation, and proper handling of piece placement and win condition checking. 

Future feature additions could include visual overhauls, futher mouseover refinements (to remove the prior color once clicked while the mouse has not yet moved), and better win/tie modals.

The codebase is awaiting review prior to basic refactoring to reduce duplicate code.
